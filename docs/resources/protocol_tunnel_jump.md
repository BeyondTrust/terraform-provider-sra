- `tunnel_definitions` (String) A description of the tunnels that should be created for the remote system, must be pairs of local and report ports.

Example: For a 2-sets of local & remote ports (22,24) and (26,28), this field must be "22;24;26;28".

The local ports must be between 0 and 65535, inclusive and the remote ports must be between 1 and 65535, inclusive.

This is a required field when the tunnel type is tcp.
